            	<p style="text-align: justify;">The centre head along with the faculty members welcomes all aspirants of higher learning to the G.D. PROFESSIONAL COLLEGE campus.</p>
            	<p style="text-align: justify;">First of all I want to discuss on the matter of unemployment, because it is the most common problem in today's society. Wrong selection of institute, wrong teaching pattern as well as the inappropriate certification causes this. With this desk, I want to aware the students to first of all, check the concern of institute along with it's teaching property.</p>
            	<p style="text-align: justify;">The wrong selection of courses is also a big problem in front of students. Many of the students do not know that what type of course would let him/her a bright future. Although there are so many short-term/long-term courses available in the market that might be beneficial for them but wrong counseling let them fall towards their precious time, money and after all their future.</p>
            	<p style="text-align: justify;">At, G.D. PROFESSIONAL COLLEGE I feel very proud to say that the relationship between faculty and students is not of conventional type, but representing a professional environment, the relationship is a bit contemporary.</p>
            	<p style="text-align: justify;">G.D. PROFESSIONAL COLLEGE is the only institution which is committed to give a strong atmosphere of education, a counselor to suggest you 'what to do?' , well qualified faculties who are always ready to remedy the conceptual problems and well equipped lab with new generation technologies of computing. Thanks all of you.</p>
